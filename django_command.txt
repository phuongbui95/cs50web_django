1. Create a django project:
django-admin startproject "project name"

2. Run an application in django:
python3 manage.py runserver
=> You may re-run this command multiple time after editing your files!

3. Create an app in django project:
python3 manage.py startapp "app name"

	4. If add a new app to django project, 
	go to setting.py/add app's name in INSTALLED APPS

	5. views.py is where to design the frontend of Django app

	6. urls.py can be additionally created in each app to manage apps' own urls
	=> After creating app's urls.py, remember to update project's urls.py as well.

	7. Use "render" instead of "HttpRespone to run an entire html"

8. Input a value into html tag => {{ your input }}

9. Create conditional statements:
{% if your condition %}
   html
{% else %}
   html
{% endif %}

10. Static file = file tĩnh, Dynamic file = file động.

11. In Django app, create a "Static" folder to store static files.

12. Create a loop statement:
{% for  in  %}
   html
{% endfor &}

13. Template inheritance: if generating multiple html files with the same layout, Django allows to utilize a "layout.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title> name </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        {% block body %}
        {% endblock %}
    </body>
</html>
